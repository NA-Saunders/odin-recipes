# odin-recipes
PART 1.
As part of the Odin project, Iâ€™m practicing my basic HTML knowledge. My basic recipe website will include a main index page with links to a few recipes, as well as a few recipe pages.

PART 2.
For the next stage of this project, I'll be adding a basic CSS file to the website to add some small style to the HTML elements.
